**Lecture 0
***What is data science?
- Data Science is the discipline that describes, predicts and makes casual inferences based on data.

***What is Artificial Intelligence
- Field of science that studies how te create computers or computer software that have intelligent behaviour

***The Data Science Progress
- Data --> Information --> Knowledge

1. <u>Ask</u> an interresting question.
2. <u>Get</u> data.
3. <u>Model</u> data.
4. <u>Communicate</u> and <u>Visualize</u> the Results

****What is Data?
- Data are <u>facts</u>
- Data can be <u>recorded</u>
- Example: 30 degrees.

****What is Information?
- Information is data presented in a <u>form/shape</u> that is <u>meaningful</u> to the recipiant.
- Data in <u>context</u>.
- Information can be used because it can be understood.

****What is Knowledge?
- Looks like information but is absolutely not the same. 
- Knowledge has <u>impact</u> on your <u>decision</u>, information doesn't.
- Knowledge is information ones you put it in <u>action</u>.
- Knowledge are <u>results</u> of <u>understanding</u> information.

*****Excercie/Example
Given the following situation:
- Movement monitors track a babyâ€™s breathing movements and trigger an alarm in case no movement (breathing) is detected.
a. Explain how measurements of baby movements could be transformed from data into information and then into knowledge.
b. Express the knowledge generated at the previous point into a rule which could be implemented

- Answer:
A. First step is to collect the <u>raw breathing data</u> of the baby. The second step is the sensor turning this data in information by detecting if the baby is still breathing. The third step is the human understanding the information and turning it in knowledge by checking upon the baby.
B. IF sensor gives alarm THEN check upon baby.

1. Breating records = data.
2. The Alarm going of = information.
3. checking upon the baby = knowledge.

ofcours this is viewed from the perspective of a human. 

***Data Scientist Skills
- You must learn to understand your data, look at it critically.
- You are looking for features that will help you determine the best way to handle, process and analyze those data, and enhance the information in the data.
- Prep work is important!

***What to know for/Know how to do for the exam.
- Definition of data, information and knowledge.
- Link between data, information and knowledge.

***Excercise 1
- Given the following situation:
Parking sensors are proximity sensors for road vehicles designed to alert the driver to obstacles while parking.

a. Explain how a measure of proximity between a road vehicle and an obstacle could be transformed from data into information and then into knowledge.
b. Express the knowledge generated at the previous point into a rule which could be implemented into a knowledge based system 

- Answer:
A. First the proximity sensor will collect raw data about the distance between the vehicle and the obstacle. Secondly the the sensor will turn this raw data in information by alarming the user when the vehicle is to close to an obstacle. Lastly the user will turn the information into knowledge by stopping the vehicle on time when the sensor beeps.
B. IF proximity sensor gives alarm THEN Stop vehicle.

***Excercice 2
- Based on the example of Homework 1, try to think of other situations that result in data being 
transferred into information and then knowledge.

- Thermostats are build to measure the room temperature. It can detect certain heights or lows and act upon them by heating or cooling down the airconditioning.
A. First the thermostat will record raw temperatures. Then it will check with the given boundaries by a third party such as a human. If it hits a certain boundaryit will turn this information into knowledge by acting upon these bounderies. It can either heating up or cool down the room.
B. IF Room temperature is to cold THEN start heating room ELSE IF Room temperature too hot THEN start cooling down room.
